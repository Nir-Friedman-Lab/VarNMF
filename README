To run on synthetic data:
1. Run
	python3 synthetic_test --cv=0.5 --K=4
2. synthetic-test-plots-final.ipynb contains the plots code

To run on cfchip data:
0. Run the notebook cfchip-prepare-data.ipynb to prepare the dataset - filter genes, split to train and test etc. (for the unsupervised1 run this is already done)
1. Run 
	python3 run_bash_cluster_pipeline.py 
   [or if you have access to slurs cluster, run python3 run_sbatch_cluster_pipeline.py]
   This will output a list of bash commands you need to run and the relevant dependencies.
2. Run the bash comments from whiten the Code dir following the dependencies 
3. You should see the NMF results in results/CRC+SCLC/unsupervised1/selected-genes/ and VarNMF results in results/CRC+SCLC/unsupervised1/selected-genes/batch2/
4. cfchip-plots-final.ipynb contains the plots code
